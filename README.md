* Android Framework with Kotlin
* MVVM architectural pattern
* LiveData and ViewModel - Android Architecture Components to survive LifeCycle events
* Dagger 2 - Dependency injection using 
* Retrofit, OkHttp and Gson - to make network calls and parse response to data classes
* RxJava - to leverage power of Reactive Programming
* RxBindings - to throttle user-input in Search field
* Glide - to increase image loading efficiency and caching
* Timber - for logging useful information
